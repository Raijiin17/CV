## Project analysis, User profile
A person who is recruiting for their company and wants to look at different portfolios. In this case, my portfolio is easy to view and pleasant; it isn’t confusing. It’s compact and contains the essential things a portfolio should have.

## Project analysis — Information architecture
I kept the site simple and easy to skim, with a sticky top menu so you can jump straight to what you need. It starts with Home, basically a quick “ID card”: name, role, and three key links (GitHub, Email, Instagram). That gives instant context without scrolling. Then About adds a short story about me and a few career objectives so it’s clear where I’m heading.

Education comes next as a short list/mini-timeline—clean, chronological, and not too wordy. In Skills, I use level bars so you can compare things at a glance; I’m not claiming scientific precision—just an honest overview of strengths. Works & Experience uses small cards with an image, a quick description of what I did (hackathon, internship, challenges), and a few keyword chips. It’s meant to show real evidence fast.

Languages is summarized with simple bars, and Contact has two parts: direct info (email, LinkedIn, location) plus a lightweight form for anyone who’d rather write right there. The overall order is “quick summary first, details after,” and every section stays short on purpose. The menu anchors keep context and reduce friction, and the layout is responsive: one column on mobile, then two columns on larger screens. Reusing the same patterns (cards, headings, spacing) keeps the whole thing predictable and easy to navigate.

## Project analysis — Visual design
The visual style is clean and low-drama. I’m using a soft neutral base with a blue accent for links and actions, so it’s obvious where to click without the page shouting at you. Content sits inside cards with rounded corners, gentle shadows, and light borders—enough separation to guide the eye, not so much that it feels boxy. Typography sticks to system fonts for speed and readability. Headings are heavier/bigger, body text has comfy line-height and spacing so the page doesn’t feel cramped.

Layout-wise, it’s fully responsive: single column on phones, two columns when there’s room, balancing text and images. Skills have animated bars (subtle, not flashy), and work cards lift slightly on hover to hint “click me” without turning the UI into a carnival. I keep consistency tight—same margins, corner radius, and shadow recipe—so every section feels like part of one system.

I also covered basic accessibility: decent contrast, visible focus states, tap-friendly targets, and alt text for images. No heavy libraries; it’s just HTML + CSS, which keeps load times snappy. There’s automatic dark mode using prefers-color-scheme, so the site respects your OS settings and isn’t blinding at night. Overall, the design gets out of the way: tidy, friendly, and focused on two things—show what I’ve done and make it easy to contact me.
